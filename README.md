Dear Discord users and/or FinalSpark enthusiasts - We are excited to announce that we have launched a new service called LiveMEA.
This allows you to record the live data from all of our MEAs in Pythonand save it to an HDF5 file for your personal use, either via an API or a CLI for ease of use.
Whether you're a researcher, artist or simply curious, we hope this will be interesting and useful to you.
You are free to modify the code and use the data as you wish, and we would love to hear about any interesting projects you create with it.
